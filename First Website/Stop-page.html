            <h1>FEATURE NOT SUPPORTED</h1>
            <p> This project objective is to show my capability to replicate a fashion site.
                <br> However, it does not include making every single page for all clothing categories and different support/about sections.
                <br> Here are all the features you can try and how to access them:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add items to your wishlist and see them listed by pressing the crown icon in the top-right corner of the screen, you can also remove them</li>
                <li>Search a specific item with the search bar</li>
                <!--<li>Change language (english and italian supported) by pressing the account button and then the language icon</li><!-->
                <li>Send an email directly to my inbox at the bottom of the page</li>
                <li>See a different layout by accessing with your smartphone (or by changing the viewport on desktop)</li>
            </ul>
